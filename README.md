# Data Preprocessing
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.
## Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```
## Filter US Jobs
To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_us = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']
```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 6 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to for data related job.

### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(top_3_jobs),1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i in range(len(top_3_jobs)):
    df_draw=df_skill_perc[df_skill_perc['job_title_short'] == top_3_jobs[i]]
    sns.barplot(data=df_draw, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills' , ax=ax[i], hue='skill_percent', palette='dark:b_r', legend= False)
    ax[i].set_title(top_3_jobs[i])
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,80)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')


fig.suptitle('Percentage of top 6 skills in job posting', fontsize =15)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_salary_analysis.ipynb](3_project/4_salary_analysis.ipynb)


#### Visualize Data

```python 
salary_list = [df_us_top6[df_us_top6['job_title_short'] == jt]['salary_year_avg'] for jt in job_titles]
sns.boxplot(data = df_us_top6 , x= 'salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order= job_order)
plt.title('Salary distribution in U.S.')
plt.xlabel('yearly salary $')
plt.ylabel('')
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x ,__ : f'${int(x/1000)}k'))
plt.xlim(0,650000)
plt.show()
```
#### Result

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

##  4. Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_salary_analysis.ipynb](3_project/4_salary_analysis.ipynb)
``` python
fig , ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

sns.barplot(data=df_us_top_pay_skill, x= 'median_sal', y=df_us_top_pay_skill.index, ax = ax[1], hue = 'median_sal', palette='dark:b_r')


sns.barplot(data=df_us_top_skill, x= 'median_sal', y=df_us_top_skill.index, ax = ax[0], hue = 'median_sal', palette='light:b')

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
#### Result
![](3_project\images\highest_paid_skill_vs_highestPaid_profile.png)
*Two separate bar graphs visualizing the highest paid skills and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US.*

Insights:

- The bottom graph shows specialized technical skills like dplyr, Bitbucket, and Gitlab are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The top graph highlights that foundational skills like Excel, PowerPoint, and SQL are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.


## 5. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_optimal_skill.ipynb](3_project/5_optimal_skill.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data

```python 
from adjustText import adjust_text

df_da_skills.plot(kind='scatter', x='skill_perc', y='Median_sal' )
plt.xlabel('percentage of job posting')
plt.ylabel('Median salary in $')
plt.title('Most optimal skills for DA in Us')
plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()

```

#### Result

![](3_project\images\scatter_plot_optimizedSkill_DA.png)
*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal skills (high paying & high demand) for data analysts in the US.*

Insights:

- Oracle, though less frequently mentioned in job postings, offers the highest median salary of nearly $97K, highlighting the premium placed on specialized database skills in data analysis.

- More common skills like Excel and SQL appear often in job listings but come with lower median salaries compared to specialized tools like Python and Tableau, which not only offer higher pay but are also seen moderately in listings.

- Skills such as Python, Tableau, and SQL Server sit at the higher end of the salary range while also being fairly common in job postings, suggesting that expertise in these tools can open up strong career opportunities in data analytics.

### Visualizing Different Techonologies


Let's visualize the different technologies as well in the graph. We'll add color labels based on the technology (e.g., {Programming: Python})

#### Visualize Data

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

# Create a scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=df_DA_skills_tech_high_demand,
    x='skill_percent',
    y='median_salary',
    hue='technology',  # Color by technology
    palette='bright',  # Use a bright palette for distinct colors
    legend='full'  # Ensure the legend is shown
)
plt.show()
```
